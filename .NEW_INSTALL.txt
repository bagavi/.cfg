On a new install, this is the stuff that I typically do:

Packages:
1. Vim
2. Git
3. My dotfiles in kanodiaayush/.cfg on github
4. Install Chrome (this is number one really)
5. Install Materia theme with Papirus Icons
6. Modify the top and bottom bars to autohide and show hide buttons (check the last three options)
7. Install the ruby gem which helps you with multi touch gestures. See # 13
8. Add SSH keys to github/bitbucket.
9. Setup Terminal Preferences -- get the correct fonts and colours.
	Font: Monospace Regular / Monaco
	BG color: #262626
	Set Unlimited Scrolling
	Font Size: 10
10. Install Anaconda
11. Setup Grive(2)
12. Fonts will be copied in ~/.fonts (specifically monaco). To load this, use 'sudo fc-cache -fv'
13. Install Fusuma: https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma | Pre requisite -- Ruby 'sudo apt install ruby-full'. The fusuma config file lies in .cfg.
14. Get Compiz. Add compiz --replace to startup applications. Go to CCSM from dashboard and enable the put extension. Set shortcut to move windows between monitors.
15. Setup Chrome and Firefox to be fullscreen (both provide this option in their settings).
16. Use Compiz to dim non active windows with a shortcut-- https://askubuntu.com/questions/828557/highlight-window-with-focus-even-more
17. Use Compiz to remove the title bar from windows when they are fullscreen -- https://planetkris.com/2009/07/how-to-remove-the-title-bar-with-compiz-without-losing-3-hours-of-your-life/
18. Use Compiz to speed up window transitions with dimming of non active windows -- https://askubuntu.com/questions/284956/dim-inactive-compiz-set-speed-of-the-effect
19. Use Compiz to allow using keyboard shortcuts to move windows between monitors -- Compiz -> window management -> Put
20. Install Vundle by cloning its git repo in the right place (see the git repo)
21. Install "touchpad-indicator" to disable touchpad when using the keyboard.
22. Remap caps lock to ctrl -- https://askubuntu.com/questions/33774/how-do-i-remap-the-caps-lock-and-ctrl-keys
23. Setup shortcut for caps lock in keyboard shortcuts -- use command 'xdotool key Caps_Lock'

Optional/System Specific:
1. Setup disk drives to be mapped to specific folders. https://askubuntu.com/questions/164926/how-to-make-partitions-mount-at-startup is a good example.
2. Install a Wallpaper Manager. Use Variety/Wallpaper Downloader: https://bitbucket.org/eloy_garcia_pca/wallpaperdownloader. The former sometimes just does not work. Enable Wallpaper Downloader as a startup application in gnome-session-properties with the command 'wallpaperdownloader'
