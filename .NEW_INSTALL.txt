On a new install, this is the stuff that I typically do:

Packages:
1. Vim
2. Git
3. My dotfiles in kanodiaayush/.cfg on github
4. Install Chrome (this is number one really)
5. Install Variety
6. Install Materia theme with Papirus Icons
7. Modify the top and bottom bars to autohide (and uncheck all else)
8. Install the ruby gem which helps you with multi touch gestures.
