On a new install, this is the stuff that I typically do:

Packages:
1. Vim
2. Git
3. My dotfiles in kanodiaayush/.cfg on github
4. Install Chrome (this is number one really)
5. Install Materia theme with Papirus Icons
6. Modify the top and bottom bars to autohide and show hide buttons (check the last three options)
7. Install the ruby gem which helps you with multi touch gestures.
8. Add SSH keys to github/bitbucket.
9. Setup Terminal Preferences -- get the correct fonts and colours.
	Font: Monospace Regular / Monaco
	BG color: #262626
	Set Unlimited Scrolling
	Font Size: 10
10. Install Anaconda
11. Setup Grive(2)
12. Fonts will be copied in ~/.fonts (specifically monaco). To load this, use 'sudo fc-cache -fv'
13. Install Fusuma: https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma | Pre requisite -- Ruby 'sudo apt install ruby-full'. The fusuma config file lies in .cfg.
14. Get Compiz. Add compiz --replace to startup applications. Go to CCSM from dashboard and enable the put extension. Set shortcut to move windows between monitors.



Optional/System Specific:
1. Setup disk drives to be mapped to specific folders. https://askubuntu.com/questions/164926/how-to-make-partitions-mount-at-startup is a good example.
2. Install a Wallpaper Manager. Use Variety/Wallpaper Downloader: https://bitbucket.org/eloy_garcia_pca/wallpaperdownloader. The former sometimes just does not work.
